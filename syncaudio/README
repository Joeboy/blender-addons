SyncAudio
=========

This code is based on Shenidam by Nabil Stendardo. The primary purpose is to
provide a convenient Blender add-on wrapper for libshenidam from Blender's
Video Sequence Editor, making it easy to sync external mic audio to camera
audio.

Cheap video cameras typically record audio along with the footage, but for
various reasons it often ends up being of fairly poor quality.  It's therefore
common to record additional audio using an external mic/recorder, but unless
you have an expensive timecode system this will be out of sync with the
footage. Using this add-on, you can easily sync your external audio to the
camera audio, and thereby to the footage. This works via something called
cross-correlation, which the author of Shenidam probably understands much
better than I do.


Building
--------

First make sure you have Shenidam built and installed. Clone it from
git@github.com:stendardo/shenidam.git. You may find you have to modify the
code slightly to get it to build:

In shenidam_main.cpp, remove or comment out:

    #include "boost/thread.hpp"

change

    num_threads = boost::thread::hardware_concurrency();

to

    num_threads = 1; // or use the number of CPU cores you have

Make sure you have the dev packages installed for sndfile, fftw3 and
samplerate, eg by:

    apt-get install libsndfile-dev libsamplerate-dev libfftw3-dev

Build syncaudio by simply typing "make" while in the syncaudio folder. This
works on my machine, which runs Ubuntu 15.04. I guess it should be fairly easy
to make it work on other Linuxes, no idea about Windows or OSX.

Then you'll need to copy it to, or symlink it from, your Blender addons folder
and enable it via Blender's User Preferences->Add-ons window.


Usage
-----

Once you have it built, installed and enabled, use it as follows:

Go to Blender's VSE, select an audio strip to align to, then select an audio
strip to align. Then press space, then type "Sync Audio". Hopefully, the second
strip you selected will now be synced to the first.
