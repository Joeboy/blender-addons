SyncAudio
=========

This code is based on shenidam by Nabil Stendardo. The primary purpose is to
provide a convenient Blender add-on wrapper to shenidam from Blender's Video
Sequence Editor.

Usage
-----

Once you have it built, installed and enabled, use it as follows:

Go to Blender's VSE, select an audio strip to align to, then select an audio
strip to align. Then press space, then type "Sync Audio". Hopefully, the second
strip you selected will now be aligned to the first.


Building
--------

To build it, first make sure you have shenidam built and installed. Clone it
from git@github.com:stendardo/shenidam.git. You may find you have to modify the
code slightly to get it to build:

In shenidam_main.cpp, remove or comment out:

    #include "boost/thread.hpp"

change

    num_threads = boost::thread::hardware_concurrency();

to

    num_threads = 1;

Make sure you have the dev packages installed for sndfile, fftw3 and
samplerate, eg by:

    apt-get install libsndfile-dev libsamplerate-dev libfftw3-dev

Build syncaudio by simply typing "make". I say simply, although obviously lots
of stuff will go wrong, because that's the way the world is.

Good luck!
