Ardour VSE Export
=================

This is an add-on for Blender, whose purpose is to export audio strips from
Blender's VSE into a new Ardour session, to allow better sound mixing/editing.

To install, copy it to, or symlink it from, your Blender addons folder and
enable it via Blender's User Preferences->Add-ons window.

To use it, select "Export VSE to Ardour", either from the Strip menu or the
spacebar list. It will create an ardour session, called 'ardour-session',
in the same folder as your .blend file.


Things that suck:
-----------------

* Not really tested or finished. It seems to work on my computer, although I
  haven't tried using it for real work yet.
* Only imports the audio strips themselves - no volume / panning data etc
* Does not resample audio, so if your audio is not recorded at 48kHz you might
  want to resample the files manually using ffmpeg/avconv or something.
* I've tested it in Blender 2.74 on Ubuntu 15.04. It might also work in Windows
  or OSX. Who knows?
* It will get confused if your project uses multiple files with the same
  name (but different locations).
