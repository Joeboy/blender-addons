This is a place to keep my blender add-ons, so I don't lose them. They're
mostly quick hacks for my own benefit, but other people might find them
useful too.

So far, these are all for working with the VSE:

Sync Audio: For syncing external audio with your crappy camera audio.

VSE export: Export your audio mix to an Ardour session for more powerful audio mixing.

Mute strip modifiers: Mute / unmute all VSE strip modifiers. Useful if modifiers are slowing down video previewing.

Open strip source: Open a VSE strip's source audio/video in an external editor.
